                <h1>Best Fried Chicken</h1>
                <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.The dish is renowned for being greasy, especially when coming from fast food outlets.It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low.Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken, the wings generally tend to contain the most fat, with almost 40 grams (1.4 oz) of fat for every 100 grams(3.5 oz).However, the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12% fat, or 12 grams (0.42 oz) per every 100 grams (3.5 oz).</p>

                    Nothing beats the addictiveness of thin, crispy, and oh-so-indulgent French fries, which make us all melt at the sight of them. Deep-fried potato fritters have piqued the interest of food lovers across continents for ages. They are one of the most popular accompaniments to various foods like sandwiches and burgers. Many restaurants that serve french fries combine servings of fries with other foods, such as fried fish or cutlets. 
                    
                    French fries can also be a satisfying snack on their own. French fries, slathered in ketchup, mayonnaise, or a variety of sauces and dips, are our go-to snack in good, bad, and ugly times. Furthermore, we have French fries because they are kid-friendly. The texture and the taste suit the palates of kids from all over the world</p>

                <h1>Noodles</h1>
                <p>Instant noodles are a type of pre-cooked noodle usually sold in individual packets, cups, or bowls. Its main ingredients are typically flour, starch, water, salt, and/or a salt substitute known as kansui, a type of alkaline mineral water that contains sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate. Palm oil is also a common ingredient in instant noodles as instant noodles were originally produced by flash frying. However, nowadays, air-dried noodles are also available. Instant noodles come with flavouring packets that contain seasoning, salt, and monosodium glutamate (MSG).

                    Instant noodles were first made in Japan in 1958. The world’s first-ever instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese inventor and businessman who founded Nissin Food Products Co. Ltd. Since its invention, instant noodles have become a well-loved convenience food for millions of consumers all over the world.</p>
